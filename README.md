# MongoDBFinder
It finds the location of MongoDB.exe in your computer for Windows 10 cmd prompt

There are two version of this file: 1) MongoDBFast_github.bat and 2) MongoDBFinder_github.bat. Which one you use depends on how comfortable you are with cmd prompt. If you are comfortable with cmd prompt and have been able to connect to MongoDB with no issues, I would suggest that you go to 2) (it is less flexible but faster). If you aren't comfortable with cmd prompt, I wrote this batch file to find mongo.exe on your computer no matter where it is located (it is more flexible but a little slower). Both require a little set up, but save you the headache of doing the process every time you need to connect to Mongo Shell.

Make sure you have:
Downloaded the MongoShell File and extracted/unzipped the contents (preferably in the downloads folder).
